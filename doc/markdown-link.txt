==============================================================================

Rationale:
This plugin allows one to quickly insert links into markdown that one is
editing.

Links in markdown can be written in muliple ways:

Option 1:
>
[This is a link](https://link.to/target)
<

Option 2:
>
[This is a link][1]

[1]: https://link.to/target
<

This plugin makes links of the second type.


markdown-link.setup({opts})                       *markdown-link.setup({opts})*
    Setup function to be run by the user. Configures what URLs are valid.

    Usage:

    >
    require("markdown-link").setup{
        valid_link_pattern = "^https?://.*".
        -- A |lua-patterns| that descibes what things in the clipboard
        -- will be accepted as urls
    }
    <

markdown-link.PasteMarkdownLink()           *markdown-link.PasteMarkdownLink()*
    Insert in link from |registers| `*` into the document, at the cursor location.

    If the content of the star-register does not match the `valid_link_pattern`
    given during setup, an error message will be shown.

    Exact functionality depends on the current |vim-modes|:

    - In |insert-mode|, the character before the cursor should be a `]`.
    - In |normal-mode|, the character under the cursor should be a `]`.
    - In [visual-mode], the selection is bracketed.

    The document is searched for lines that define links:
    `[NN]: UUU` where NN is a number. If there is already a number defined for
    this url, that number is reused; else a new line with a new number is
    added to the end of the document (if this is the first link, two newlines are
    added between the text and the block of links).

    Finally, the number is added to the current cursor position so that the link
    is made.
